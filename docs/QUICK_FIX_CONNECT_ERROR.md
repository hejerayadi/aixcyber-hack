# 🔧 Quick Fix: "connectToLocalWallet is not a function"

## ✅ What I Fixed

The connection method has been updated to automatically detect and use the correct HashConnect v3 API methods.

## 🎯 What to Do Now

### 1. **Restart Your Dev Server**
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C if running)
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Open Browser Console**
- Press **F12** in your browser
- Click on **Console** tab
- Keep it open to see debug messages

### 3. **Test the Connection**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/wallet`
2. Look in console for: `"HashConnect initialized successfully"`
3. Look for: `"Available methods: [...]"`
4. Click **"Connect HashPack"** button
5. Check console for connection messages

### 4. **What You Should See in Console**

✅ **Success**:
```
HashConnect initialized successfully
Available methods: [...findLocalWallets, connectToExtension...]
Attempting to connect to HashPack...
Found wallet extensions: [{name: "HashPack", ...}]
```

❌ **If you see errors**:
```
Error: HashPack extension not found
```
→ **Install HashPack**: https://www.hashpack.app/

```
Error: Unable to connect. HashConnect API methods not found
```
→ **Reinstall dependencies**: `npm install hashconnect@latest`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check HashPack Extension
1. Click HashPack icon in browser toolbar
2. Make sure it's **unlocked** (not showing password screen)
3. Verify it says **"Testnet"** at the top

### Step 2: Clear Build Cache
```bash
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Check Versions
```bash
npm list hashconnect
# Should show: hashconnect@3.0.14
```

### Step 4: Reinstall if Needed
```bash
npm uninstall hashconnect @hashgraph/sdk
npm install hashconnect@latest @hashgraph/sdk@latest
npm run dev
```

## 📋 Expected Behavior

1. **Page loads** → "Ready" badge appears
2. **Click "Connect HashPack"** → Console shows "Attempting to connect..."
3. **HashPack popup appears** → Approve the connection
4. **Account ID displays** → Connection successful! 🎉

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Keep browser console open (F12) to see what's happening
- Make sure HashPack is unlocked before connecting
- Use Testnet for development (not Mainnet)
- Check console for debug messages if something fails
